Segmentation is the process of visualizing and separating different objects in an image depending on some data attributes
data attributes: pixel intensities, depth, or any other data attributes may be accomplished with each pixel or with a set of neighboring pixels
We will do it using pixel intensities on grayscale images using K-means.
